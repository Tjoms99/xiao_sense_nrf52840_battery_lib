properties:
  charging-enable-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO used to enable charging

  read-enable-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: GPIO used to enable the readout of the charging voltage

  charge-speed-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: GPIO used to select the charging speed (high = 100mA, low = 50mA)

  adc-input-id:
    type: int
    default: 7
    description: ADC channel id

  adc-gain:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: ADC channel gain factor. ADC-reference * 6 = 3.6V

  adc-reference:
    type: int
    default: 4
    description: ADC reference. usually 0.6V.

  adc-channel:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: ADC channel to read out the battery voltage. Usually AIN7.

  adc-channel-id:
    type: int
    default: 7
    description: ADC channel to read out the battery voltage

  adc-resolution:
    type: int
    default: 12
    description: ADC resolution

  adc-sample-interval:
    type: int
    default: 500
    description: defines the time between each sample in [us].

  adc-total-samples:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      Change this to a higher number for better averages
      Note that increasing this holds up the thread / ADC for longer.

  adc-acquisition-time:
      type: int
      default: 0
      description: ADC Acquisition time

  battery-callbacks-max:
      type: int
      default: 3
      description: |
        Defines the number of battery callbacks.
        Feel free to increas it if necessary.
